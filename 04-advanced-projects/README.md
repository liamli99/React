## Projects Setup

- each project contains final/starter
- final - complete app
- starter - well project starter (our starting point)
  - contains some useful assets : data, css , etc.
- can work in main directory (cd) or remove starter (my preferred method)
- all projects built with VITE (boilerplate)

- install deps

```sh
npm install
```

- spin up dev server

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Steps

- in README.md you will find steps
- you can try to complete the entire app before watching or before each video

Therefore, feel free to interpret these steps in your own way and adapt them to your unique circumstances.
